# Database Operations

This repository stores scripts used to manipulate data working for the ARM project as an intern at ORNL. All python scripts were run in Python `3.6.8`.

## Usage

To use this repository, assuming you have access to the ARM database, simply clone it into an SSH tunnel, using:

```
git clone git@github.com:vivaansinghvi07/database-operations.git
```

Then, open the directory containing the repository and navigate to `database/` and create a `conf.ini` file with your credentials to each database. Now, you should be able to use any of the scripts.
